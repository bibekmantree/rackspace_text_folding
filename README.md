# Rackspace_text_folding

Executed this script and output is added to repo. This script is written in python3.
```
cat input.txt | python3 script.py >output.txt
```
##My Logic goes like this:
1. Created chunk of lines on basis of */Asterisk appearance.
2. Process and print each chunk as per requirement, making sure the numeric bullet and +/- code folding is in place.
